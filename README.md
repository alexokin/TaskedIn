# TaskedIn - Project management app inspired by trello.com
## Tech Stack
The tech stack we used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js. The app uses webSockets to update the board in real-time. The API calls to the backend are done with the REST API method , and we used middlewares to authenticate and authorize actions.

We have used many third party libraries for many goals, React D&D and more. The pixel-perfect layout was made with Sass (functions, mixins, variables).
